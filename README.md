# Pytorch dataset loader of Waymo Open Dataset v2 for LiDAR Segmentation and range image projection
Convert the `.parquet` files from v2.0.0 dataset into pointclouds and semantic and instance labels for LiDAR scans. This will be useful for LiDAR scans visualization, semantic segmentation learning with pytorch framework.
This tools will create a preprocessed dataset with:
- training set:
  - 798 sequences
  - 158081 pointclouds in `process/training/pointcloud`
  - 23691 key pointclouds in `process/training/pointcloud_key`
  - 23691 labels in `process/training/semantic`, `process/training/instance`
- validation set:
  - 202 sequences
  - 39987 pointclouds in `process/validation/pointcloud`
  - 5976 key pointclouds in `process/validation/pointcloud_key`
  - 5976 labels in `process/validation/semantic`, `process/validation/instance`
- testing set:
  - 16 sequences
  - 3101 pointclouds in `process/validation/pointcloud`

The lidar `calibration` for each sequence is generated in `process/[training/validation/testing]/calibration`, which is used during range projection. Besides, the corresponing `pose` for each `poinctcloud` is generated in `process/[training/validation/testing]/pose`, which is currently not used in this tool but can be used in odometry or localization tasks. If you want to include more information from dataset to facilitate your tasks, add some codes to `preoprocess.py` just like how `pose` does and change `dataset.py` acorrddingly.

The generated `pointcloud` only use the first return of LiDAR scans, as the second return have points much lesser than the first return. For the case you really need the second return you should change the code acorrddingly.

# Waymo Open Dataset
[Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/) [Download](https://waymo.com/open/download/) [Documentation](https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset)

## This tool use the v2.0.0 version of dataset
[v2 documentation](https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial_v2.ipynb)

# Requirements
- Requirements for preprocess only:
  - dask, for dataframe loading
  - waymo_open_dataset, official released api, based on tensorflow
- Requirements for dataloader during model training & inference:
  - numba, jit the python funtion during range projection

# Usage
## Dataset Download
Downloads [waymo_open_dataset_v_2_0_0](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_2_0_0) or use the scripts below to download a mini version of waymo_open_dataset_v_2_0_0.
```bash
cd waymo-mini
./run.sh
```
You may need to init [gsutils](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/discover-object-storage-gcloud?hl=zh_CN&_ga=2.213582103.-2027393445.1701001832) at first.

## Dataset Preprocess
```bash
python preprocess.py /path/to/your/waymo/dataset
```
This will create a preprocessed dataset in the directory where your dataset locates.

## Load pointclouds and labels for training
```python
from waymo_open_dataset_loader.dataset import Waymo

data_path = '/home/yuminghuang/dataset/waymo-mini'
dataset = Waymo(root=data_path, version='v2.0.0', split='train', has_image=False, has_label=True)
pointcloud, sem_label, inst_label = dataset.loadDataByIndex(index=0)
print("pointcloud, sem_label, inst_label", pointcloud, sem_label, inst_label)

import open3d as o3d
import numpy as np
pcd = o3d.geometry.PointCloud()
pcd.points = o3d.utility.Vector3dVector(np.asarray(pointcloud[:, :3], dtype=np.float32))
pcd.colors = o3d.utility.Vector3dVector(np.asarray(dataset.sem_color_lut[sem_label], dtype=np.float32))
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd])
```

### Parameters
- split: `train`, `val`, or `test`.
- has_image: Image loader not implemented yet, only `False` suportted.
- has_label: Decides how many pointcloud will be loaded.
  - If `has_label=True`, the subset of pointclouds in the sequences with semantic labels will be loaded.
  - If `has_label=False`, all the pointclouds in the sequences will be loaded. 
  
  Usually, the former is used with training and validation. And the latter is used for inference where no annotation is needed.

## Project pointclouds to RANGE images
```python
from waymo_open_dataset_loader.dataset import Waymo
from waymo_open_dataset_loader.projection import RangeProjection

data_path = '/home/yuminghuang/dataset/waymo-mini'
dataset = Waymo(root=data_path, version='v2.0.0', split='train', has_image=False, has_label=False)
pointcloud, sem_label, inst_label = dataset.loadDataByIndex(0)
extrinsic, inclination = dataset.loadCalibrationByIndex(0)
proj_pointcloud, proj_range, proj_idx, proj_mask = RangeProjection(64, 2650).doProjection(pointcloud, extrinsic, inclination)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(proj_range)
plt.show()
```
